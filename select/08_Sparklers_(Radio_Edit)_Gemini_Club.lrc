[00:03.55] I don't know
[00:05.10] Or understand
[00:06.51] You say it's hard right now
[00:08.44] It's in my head
[00:09.60] Spending all my time
[00:11.64] Keep you wide awake
[00:21.14] 
[00:41.92] It's hard to know the ending yet
[00:44.67] Because your heart, right now
[00:46.71] Is in my hands
[00:47.93] And it's all I know
[00:49.82] It's all I can keep safe
[01:01.82] 
[00:55.33] So drive off the freeway
[00:57.01] Cause that wouldn't kill you
[00:58.74] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:02.68] And take all your money
[01:03.60] I told you to spend it
[01:05.78] You'll never need anything
[01:06.89] You and I
[01:11.39] 
[01:20.46] Climb every night in your burning tree
[01:23.14] And keep you head up tight
[01:24.89] With your broken needs
[01:26.64] And keep your guard up now
[01:28.11] And you'll only see it's not the fighting time
[01:31.29] Don't go retreat
[01:32.95] When you climb every night on your frozen peak
[01:35.82] Keep your eyes on mine with your broken needs
[01:39.12] And keep your arms up high
[01:40.84] So that I can see the light
[01:54.34] 
[02:11.68] Waiting on my own
[02:13.24] Waiting all this time
[02:14.58] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:16.34] Tell me what I want
[02:17.45] And tell that will never change
[02:19.59] That will never change
[02:20.69] You'll turn your back again
[02:22.85] Turn your back again
[02:23.94] Never leave me all alone
[02:26.01] Leave me like you did
[02:27.13] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:29.17] Tell me what I want
[02:30.25] And tell me that will never change
[02:32.35] That will never change
[02:33.41] You'll never turn your back again
[02:35.66] Turn your back again
