Bottle rockets and smoke bombs lying dead on the sidewalk
Are black marks on the concrete now but they were beautiful last night
A picture of our life, can we make this what it was?

Everything is right, everything is wrong
Sparklers only burn for so long

Tightrope walking, balancing on a thin telephone line
The wind blows and you want to call it off, the cars below keep going by
And now you're getting tired, careful you're gonna fall

Everything is right, everything is wrong
Sparklers only burn for so long

I'm a pendulum that swings trapped in the disappearing
Of a setting sun, the moonlight at dawn
A book of matches burning in its own reflection

Everything is right, everything is wrong
Letting go is the best way to hold on
So watch the light dance in the dark until it's gone
Sparklers only burn for so long
