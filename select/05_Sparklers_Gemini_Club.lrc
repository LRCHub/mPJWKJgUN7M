[00:02.57] And I don't know
[00:04.38] Or understand
[00:05.27] You say it's hard right now
[00:07.02] It's in my head
[00:08.82] Spending all my time
[00:10.67] Keep you wide awake
[00:20.17] 
[00:41.56] It's hard to know the ending yet
[00:44.45] 'Cause your heart right now
[00:46.16] Is in my hands
[00:47.31] And it's all I know
[00:49.37] It's all I can keep safe
[01:01.37] 
[00:54.79] So drive up the freeway
[00:56.56] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[00:58.55] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:01.53] And take all your money
[01:03.04] I told you to spend it
[01:04.81] You'll never need anything
[01:06.38] You and I
[01:10.88] 
[01:07.75] So drive up the freeway
[01:09.39] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[01:11.24] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:14.19] And take all your money
[01:15.72] I told you to spend it
[01:17.76] You'll never need anything
[01:19.16] You and I
[01:23.66] 
[01:20.07] Climb every night in your burning tree
[01:22.62] And keep your head up tight
[01:24.25] With your broken needs
[01:25.93] And keep your guard up now
[01:27.63] And you'll only see it's not the fighting time
[01:31.15] Don't go, retreat
[01:39.65] 
[01:32.21] And when you climb every night on your frozen peak
[01:35.41] And keep your eyes on mine with your broken needs
[01:38.52] And keep your arms up high
[01:40.32] So that I can see the light
[01:53.82] 
[01:46.14] So drive up the freeway
[01:47.89] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[01:49.58] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:52.58] And take all your money
[01:54.06] I told you to spend it
[01:55.91] You'll never need anything
[01:57.53] You and I
[02:02.03] 
[02:11.15] Waiting on my own
[02:12.97] Waiting all this time
[02:14.29] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:16.08] Tell me what I want
[02:16.91] And tell me that will never change
[02:19.09] That will never change
[02:20.16] You'll never turn your back again
[02:22.35] Turn your back again
[02:32.35] 
[02:23.59] Never leave me all alone
[02:25.50] Leave me like you did
[02:26.63] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:28.60] Tell me what I want
[02:29.66] And tell me that will never change
[02:32.09] That will never change
[02:32.97] You'll never turn your back again
[02:35.30] Turn your back again
[02:45.30] 
[02:50.05] So drive up the freeway
[02:51.81] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[02:53.72] It would only ease your worried mind
[02:56.79] And take all your money
[02:58.21] I told you to spend it
[02:59.93] You'll never need anything
[03:01.60] You and I
