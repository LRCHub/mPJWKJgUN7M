I wrote your name in cursive on the air
Flailing my arms around me
Conducting down to the wire

I felt our time was a running, a sparking sun
Before we were dying, rained out, reaching
For another one, quick
I only wrote it to the wind
Conjuring no lasting magic

See the haze of sulphur rising
On the breeze
I see now, you were patronizing
The cause of my chemistries

I felt our time was a running, a sparking sun
Before we were dying, rained out, reaching
For another one, quick
I only wrote it to the wind
Conjuring no lasting magic
