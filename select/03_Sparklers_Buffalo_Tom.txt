In the colored light there stands you
The end is in sight no need to fight anymore
They're hot in pursuit and they're pursuin' you
All the way home and now you're finally alone
All the way back home

Now you're catching dust like desire
Stockpiling stars collecting their wildfire
Fireworks outside its the fourth of July
Now I see you, you're in a different light
You're in a different light

Like the rain when you're conscious of it
She was sparkles
Like a drug on the tip of your tongue
She gives sparkles
She was sparklers

They gunned him down outside
How long does it take? Shots echoes 'cross the lake
And there he stood in a puddle of his own blood
Slighter than snowflakes earth began to quake
All the way back home

Like the rain when you're conscious of it
She was sparkles
Like a drug on the tip of your tongue
She gives sparkles
She was sparklers

Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain when you're conscious of it
She was sparkles
Like a drug on the tip of your tongue
She gives sparkles
She was sparklers
She was sparklers
