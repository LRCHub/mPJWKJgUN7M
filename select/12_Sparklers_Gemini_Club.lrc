[00:03.02] And I don't know
[00:04.85] Or understand
[00:06.03] You say it's hard right now
[00:07.82] It's in my head
[00:09.24] Spending all my time
[00:11.30] Keep you wide awake
[00:20.80] 
[00:41.70] It's hard to know the ending yet
[00:44.41] 'Cause your heart right now
[00:46.32] Is in my hands
[00:47.73] And it's all I know
[00:49.59] It's all I can keep safe
[01:01.59] 
[00:55.18] So drive up the freeway
[00:56.77] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[00:58.65] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:01.60] And take all your money
[01:03.13] I told you to spend it
[01:04.84] You'll never need anything
[01:06.66] You and I
[01:11.16] 
[01:07.99] So drive up the freeway
[01:09.68] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[01:11.40] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:14.49] And take all your money
[01:16.16] I told you to spend it
[01:17.74] You'll never need anything
[01:19.40] You and I
[01:23.90] 
[01:20.19] Climb every night in your burning tree
[01:22.83] And keep your head up tight
[01:24.40] With your broken needs
[01:26.06] And keep your guard up now
[01:27.99] And you'll only see it's not the fighting time
[01:30.97] Don't go, retreat
[01:39.47] 
[01:32.69] And when you climb every night on your frozen peak
[01:35.74] And keep your eyes on mine with your broken needs
[01:39.00] And keep your arms up high
[01:40.41] So that I can see the light
[01:53.91] 
[01:46.19] So drive up the freeway
[01:48.11] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[01:49.72] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:52.90] And take all your money
[01:54.23] I told you to spend it
[01:56.05] You'll never need anything
[01:57.80] You and I
[02:02.30] 
[02:11.42] Waiting on my own
[02:13.02] Waiting all this time
[02:14.25] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:16.12] Tell me what I want
[02:17.26] And tell me that will never change
[02:19.30] That will never change
[02:20.50] You'll never turn your back again
[02:22.45] Turn your back again
[02:32.45] 
[02:23.78] Never leave me all alone
[02:25.79] Leave me like you did
[02:26.85] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:28.94] Tell me what I want
[02:30.04] And tell me that will never change
[02:32.04] That will never change
[02:33.25] You'll never turn your back again
[02:35.18] Turn your back again
[02:45.18] 
[02:50.24] So drive up the freeway
[02:52.11] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[02:53.67] It would only ease your worried mind
[02:56.72] And take all your money
[02:58.32] I told you to spend it
[02:59.94] You'll never need anything
[03:01.96] You and I
