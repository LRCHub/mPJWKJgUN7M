[00:02.67] And I don't know
[00:04.34] Or understand
[00:05.36] You say it's hard right now
[00:07.15] It's in my head
[00:08.84] Spending all my time
[00:10.70] Keep you wide awake
[00:20.20] 
[00:41.56] It's hard to know the ending yet
[00:44.31] 'Cause your heart right now
[00:46.17] Is in my hands
[00:47.23] And it's all I know
[00:49.38] It's all I can keep safe
[01:01.38] 
[00:54.81] So drive up the freeway
[00:56.54] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[00:58.42] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:01.41] And take all your money
[01:02.96] I told you to spend it
[01:04.86] You'll never need anything
[01:06.45] You and I
[01:10.95] 
[01:07.72] So drive up the freeway
[01:09.37] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[01:11.22] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:14.19] And take all your money
[01:15.73] I told you to spend it
[01:17.72] You'll never need anything
[01:19.17] You and I
[01:23.67] 
[01:20.10] Climb every night in your burning tree
[01:22.60] And keep your head up tight
[01:24.21] With your broken needs
[01:25.92] And keep your guard up now
[01:27.62] And you'll only see it's not the fighting time
[01:31.00] Don't go, retreat
[01:39.50] 
[01:32.29] And when you climb every night on your frozen peak
[01:35.46] And keep your eyes on mine with your broken needs
[01:38.66] And keep your arms up high
[01:40.34] So that I can see the light
[01:53.84] 
[01:46.21] So drive up the freeway
[01:47.87] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[01:49.51] It would only ease your worried mind
[01:52.52] And take all your money
[01:54.04] I told you to spend it
[01:55.94] You'll never need anything
[01:57.51] You and I
[02:02.01] 
[02:11.15] Waiting on my own
[02:12.88] Waiting all this time
[02:14.13] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:16.06] Tell me what I want
[02:16.95] And tell me that will never change
[02:19.09] That will never change
[02:20.02] You'll never turn your back again
[02:22.36] Turn your back again
[02:32.36] 
[02:23.57] Never leave me all alone
[02:25.45] Leave me like you did
[02:26.56] And won't you tell me what I know
[02:28.61] Tell me what I want
[02:29.67] And tell me that will never change
[02:32.03] That will never change
[02:32.91] You'll never turn your back again
[02:35.18] Turn your back again
[02:45.18] 
[02:50.05] So drive up the freeway
[02:51.82] 'Cause that wouldn't kill you
[02:53.70] It would only ease your worried mind
[02:56.65] And take all your money
[02:58.11] I told you to spend it
[02:59.87] You'll never need anything
[03:01.51] You and I
